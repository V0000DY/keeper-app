# Keeper app

"Keeper app" is a one-page application for leaving all kinds of notes. Like paper notes with adhesive backing. You can add a virtually unlimited number of notes to your workspace! This could be a reminder, to-do list, shopping list, contact information, or a friendly message. Notes can be deleted after use. The application is built on the popular React.js framework. The useState hook is used to store a list of notes.
